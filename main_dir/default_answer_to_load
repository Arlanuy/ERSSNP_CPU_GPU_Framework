2-Load an evolutionary process from a configuration file
test.yaml - name of the loadfile
2-1 for CPU or 2 for GPU execution choice (Query 3)

If you choose 1 above instead for Query 3
	when u want to increase the runs/generation/population:
	1-Would you either increase (1) runs/generations/population_size
	1 - runs you would like to add
	2 - generations you would like to add
	4 - individuals in the population you would like to add
	Y - to use another savefile
	test2.yaml

	when u want to have a maximum fitness goal (goes to 100 generations as limit if the goal is never reached):
	2-Would you either increase (2) a goal fitness of any chromosome in the evolutionary process:
	99 or 100 for perfect but hard if not possible
	Y
	testandextra1new.yaml



	when you just want to maintain current number of generations and population_size (this will go here in default if you choose GPU for the 3rd query):
	1-runs we like to add
	0,1-denotes the first run (index 0) and the second generation (index 1) as the initial parents of the zeroth generation of this additional run
	Y - if you would like to use another savefile
	test_gpu.yaml
