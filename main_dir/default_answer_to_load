	4
	Y
	testandextra1new.yaml

	when u want to have a maximum fitness goal (goes to 100 generations as limit if the goal is never reached):
	2
	2
	99 or 100 for perfect but hard if not possible
	Y
	testandextra1new.yaml



	when you just want to maintain current number of generations and population_size (this will go here in default if you choose GPU for the 3rd query):
	1-runs we like to add
	0,1-denotes the first run (index 0) and the second generation (index 1) as the initial parents of the zeroth generation of this additional run
